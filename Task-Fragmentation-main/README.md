# Refactoring for Code Fragmentation

This repository contains a refactoring of an existing codebase to improve readability and maintainability by introducing code fragmentation. The primary goal is to break down a large, monolithic component into smaller, focused components and hooks.

## Folder Structure

### Before (Legacy Code)

The original code, available in the "before" folder, had a single, medium-length page containing both UI and functionality. This approach made it challenging to understand and maintain the codebase as it lacked clear separation of concerns.

### After (Refactored Code)

The "after" folder contains the refactored code with a more organized folder structure:

- **components/after:**
  - **SomeComponent.js:** A reusable UI component responsible for rendering a specific part of the page.
  - **AnotherComponent.js:** Another UI component with its own state and functionality, promoting modularity.
  - **hooks/useSomeFeature.js:** A custom hook encapsulating logic related to a specific feature, promoting reusability and separation of concerns.

## Justification for Code Fragmentation

1. **Modularity:**
   - The refactoring introduces smaller, focused components and hooks, promoting modularity.
   - Each component/hook has a single responsibility, making it easier to understand, test, and maintain.

2. **Reusability:**
   - Components and hooks are designed to be reusable across different parts of the application.
   - Custom hooks encapsulate specific functionality, allowing them to be easily integrated into other components.

3. **Readability:**
   - The separation of concerns improves code readability. Developers can quickly locate and understand specific functionality by looking at isolated components and hooks.

4. **Maintainability:**
   - With a modular structure, maintenance becomes more straightforward. Changes to a specific feature or UI element can be isolated to its corresponding component or hook.

5. **Scalability:**
   - The refactoring lays the foundation for scalability. As the codebase grows, new components and hooks can be added without significantly impacting existing code.

## Conclusion

Code fragmentation improves the overall structure of the codebase, making it more readable, maintainable, and scalable. This approach aligns with best practices for React development and enhances collaboration among team members working on different parts of the application.
